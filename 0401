vi Commands

vi commands are used in "screen" mode (the default), where you use the commands to move around the screen and to        per~form operations on the text.

Most vi commands follow a general pattern:
     [command][number]textobject
or the equivalent form:
     [number][command]textobject

Movement Commands

vi movement commands distinguish between two kinds of "words" The lowercase commands define a word as a contig~uous
sequence of underscores, letters,and digits. The upper~case commands define a word as a contiguous sequence of nonwhitespace characters.
